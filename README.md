# Machine Learning Foundations & Applications

This repository contains a series of projects focusing on fundamental Machine Learning algorithms, implemented from scratch and using industry standard libraries.

##Projects Included:
* **Linear & Logistic Regression:** Implementing predictive models for continuous and categorical data, including the use of **Sigmoid** activation functions.
* **K-Means Clustering:** Unsupervised learning for data segmentation and pattern recognition.
* **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** Advanced probabilistic clustering for complex data distributions.
* **Classification & Decision Boundaries:** Analyzing model performance and visualizing decision lines.

##Technical Stack:
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib (for visualization).
## Key Concepts:
Optimization, Gradient Descent, Probability Distributions, and Statistical Modeling.
